## My Personal Site

Hello, my name is Radhi Rasho and this is the Github Repository for my [personal site](https://www.radhi-rasho.dev/).

I built this site using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) as a sort of hub for all my side projects and a portfolio site to display my skills as a software engineer.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server using:

```bash
bun dev
```

This should let you know that the project is running at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

This project uses [Tailwind Css](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling and uses [Shadcn UI](https://ui.shadcn.com/) for components that you can manupulate by modifying yourself in `./components/ui`, give it a try, it's honestly one of the best component libraries I've seen so far, and part of that is because you can modify them however you want.

## Deploy on Vercel

Deployment of this project is done through [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) mostly because I didn't want to go through the hastle of setting up everything (sue me).

Kidding aside, I also mainly wanted to see how everything work especially how creating separate branches would result in preview site being created and allowing you to view them and deploy them easily via GIT essentially.
